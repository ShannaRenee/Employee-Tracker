## Description
This command line application was created so that administrators can access the information in their companies database with ease.
Users can view information about employees, roles, and departments within the company as well as add new departments, roles, and employees
with a few simple prompts. The purpose of this application is to bridge the gap so that non-developers or those unfamiliar working with
SQL can query a database without frustration. Through working on this project, I feel as though I learned a lot by overcoming frequent challenges, 
my understanding of SQL syntax has greatly improved, and I pressed myself to think outside the box when I felt as though my inspiration was running dry.
Overall, I feel as though this application challenged me as much as I challenged it, with the outcome being an efficient product for those uninitiated
with MySQL.
